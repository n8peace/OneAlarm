# Branch-Based CI/CD Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Objective**: Migrate OneAlarm from separate Supabase projects to a single project with multiple branches, implementing automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

**Current State**: 
- Two separate Supabase projects (dev/prod)
- Manual deployment process
- External cron job management
- Fully operational system

**Target State**:
- Single Supabase project with branches
- Automated CI/CD pipeline
- Branch-per-feature development
- Zero-downtime deployments

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### **Branch Strategy**
```
main (Production)
├── Live production environment
├── Manual approval required
├── Full cron schedule
└── Production user data

develop (Staging)
├── Integration testing
├── Automated deployment
├── Reduced cron frequency
└── Test data only

feature/* (Feature Development)
├── Feature development
├── Automated deployment
├── Cron jobs disabled
└── Isolated test data
```

### **GitHub Branch Mapping**
```
GitHub Branch → Supabase Branch
main → main (production)
develop → develop (staging)
feature/* → feature-* (feature branches)
hotfix/* → hotfix-* (emergency fixes)
```

### **CI/CD Workflow**
```
Feature Branch → Develop Branch → Main Branch
     ↓              ↓              ↓
   Feature      Integration    Production
  Testing        Testing       Release
```
