# Workflow Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document explains the cleanup of GitHub Actions workflows to eliminate redundancy and align with Supabase GitHub integration.

## Problem
You were seeing multiple overlapping workflows:
- **Develop branch**: 2 workflows running (Deploy to Development + Deploy to Branch)
- **Main branch**: 2 workflows running (Deploy to Production + Deploy to Production (Main))

## Root Cause
You had 4 deployment workflows that were overlapping:
1. `deploy-dev.yml` - Triggers on `develop` ✅ **KEPT** (updated for Supabase integration)
2. `deploy-prod.yml` - Triggers on `main` ✅ **KEPT** (updated for Supabase integration)
3. `deploy-main.yml` - Triggers on `main` ❌ **DISABLED** (old manual deployment)
4. `deploy-branch.yml` - Triggers on `develop, feature/*` ❌ **DISABLED** (old manual deployment)

## Solution
Disabled the old workflows that do manual deployments since Supabase GitHub integration now handles all deployments automatically.

## Current Active Workflows

### ✅ **Active Workflows (Keep These)**

#### CI/Testing Workflows
- **`ci.yml`** - General CI for all branches
- **`feature-ci.yml`** - Feature branch validation
- **`test-secrets.yml`** - Secret validation

#### Validation Workflows (No Deployment)
- **`deploy-dev.yml`** - Development environment validation only
- **`deploy-prod.yml`** - Production environment validation only

#### Utility Workflows
- **`promote-to-production.yml`** - Manual promotion workflow
- **`daily-content.yml`** - Daily content generation
- **`cron-migration.yml`** - Scheduled migrations
- **`cleanup-branches.yml`** - Branch cleanup

### ❌ **Disabled Workflows (Renamed to .disabled)**

#### Old Manual Deployment Workflows
- **`deploy-branch.yml.disabled`** - Old branch deployment (manual Supabase CLI)
- **`deploy-main.yml.disabled`** - Old main deployment (manual Supabase CLI)

## New Workflow Behavior

### **Develop Branch**
- ✅ **1 workflow**: `deploy-dev.yml` (validation only)
- ✅ **Supabase**: Automatic deployment to preview environment

### **Main Branch**  
- ✅ **1 workflow**: `deploy-prod.yml` (validation only)
- ✅ **Supabase**: Automatic deployment to production environment

### **Feature Branches**
- ✅ **1 workflow**: `feature-ci.yml` (validation only)
- ✅ **Supabase**: Automatic deployment to preview environment (if configured)

## Benefits

1. **No More Duplicate Workflows** - Each branch now has exactly one workflow
2. **Faster Execution** - No redundant deployment steps
3. **Cleaner Logs** - Easier to understand what's happening
4. **Supabase Integration** - All deployments handled automatically by Supabase

## What You Should See Now

### **Develop Branch Push**
- ✅ `deploy-dev.yml` runs (validation only)
- ✅ Supabase automatically deploys to preview environment

### **Main Branch Push**  
- ✅ `deploy-prod.yml` runs (validation only)
- ✅ Supabase automatically deploys to production environment

### **Feature Branch Push**
- ✅ `feature-ci.yml` runs (validation only)
- ✅ Supabase automatically deploys to preview environment

## If You Need to Re-enable Old Workflows

If you ever need to re-enable the old workflows:
```bash
mv .github/workflows/deploy-branch.yml.disabled .github/workflows/deploy-branch.yml
mv .github/workflows/deploy-main.yml.disabled .github/workflows/deploy-main.yml
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the cleaned workflow** - Push to develop/main to verify only one workflow runs
2. **Monitor Supabase dashboard** - Verify deployments are working correctly
3. **Delete disabled files** - Once you're confident, you can delete the `.disabled` files
