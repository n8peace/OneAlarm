## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **Supabase Branch Strategy**
```
Main Branch (Production):
├── Supabase Project: joyavvleaxqzksopnmjs (OneAlarm)
├── Branch: main
├── Environment: production
├── API Keys: Production keys
└── Cron Schedule: Current schedule

Development Branch:
├── Supabase Project: joyavvleaxqzksopnmjs (OneAlarm)
├── Branch: develop
├── Environment: development
├── API Keys: Same as production (shared)
└── Cron Schedule: Reduced frequency

Feature Branches:
├── Supabase Project: joyavvleaxqzksopnmjs (OneAlarm)
├── Branch: feature-*
├── Environment: feature-specific
├── API Keys: Same as production (shared)
└── Cron Schedule: Disabled
```

### **GitHub Branch Mapping**
```
GitHub Branch → Supabase Branch
main → main (production)
develop → develop (staging)
feature/* → feature-* (feature branches)
hotfix/* → hotfix-* (emergency fixes)
```

### **Repository Structure**
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Branch Management Commands**
```bash
# Create development branch
supabase branch create develop

# Switch to development branch
supabase branch switch develop

# Create feature branch
supabase branch create feature/new-feature

# List all branches
supabase branch list

# Merge feature branch to develop
supabase branch merge feature/new-feature develop

# Delete feature branch
supabase branch delete feature/new-feature
```

### **Environment Configuration**
```bash
# Branch-specific environment variables
SUPABASE_BRANCH=main|develop|feature-*
SUPABASE_URL=https://joyavvleaxqzksopnmjs.supabase.co
SUPABASE_BRANCH_URL=https://joyavvleaxqzksopnmjs.supabase.co/branches/${SUPABASE_BRANCH}
```

### **GitHub Actions Workflow Structure**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-branch.yml
name: Deploy to Branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [develop, feature/*]
  pull_request:
    branches: [develop, main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy to Supabase Branch
        run: |
          supabase branch switch ${{ github.head_ref }}
          supabase db push
