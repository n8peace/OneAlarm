# Trigger Sync Summary

## Problem Identified

**Root Cause:** Both main and develop environments had the same critical issue:
- The `trigger_audio_generation` function was trying to use `net.http_post`
- The `net` extension is not available in Supabase environments
- This caused "schema 'net' does not exist" errors

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Complete Trigger Synchronization

**Created:** `scripts/sync-main-to-develop-complete.sql`

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Removed all `net.http_post` calls from trigger functions
- ✅ Implemented queue-based approach for audio generation
- ✅ Synchronized trigger functions between main and develop
- ✅ Ensured required tables (`audio_generation_queue`, `logs`) exist
- ✅ Added performance indexes
- ✅ Comprehensive logging of all changes

### 2. Updated Functions

#### `trigger_audio_generation()`
- **Before:** Used `net.http_post` to call generate-audio directly
- **After:** Uses queue-based approach with `audio_generation_queue` table
- **Triggers:** `on_preferences_updated`, `on_preferences_inserted`

#### `manage_alarm_audio_queue()`
- **Before:** Used `queue_audio_generation` function
- **After:** Direct queue insertion with proper logging
- **Triggers:** `alarm_audio_queue_trigger`

### 3. Queue System

**Table:** `audio_generation_queue`
- Centralized queue for all audio generation requests
- Priority system (1=high for preferences, 2=normal for alarms)
- Status tracking (pending, processing, completed, failed)
- Scheduled 58 minutes before alarm time

### 4. Logging System

**Enhanced logging for:**
- User preference changes
- Alarm creation/updates
- Environment synchronization
- Queue operations

## Files Created/Updated

### Scripts
- `scripts/sync-main-to-develop-complete.sh` - Main sync script
- `scripts/sync-main-to-develop-complete.sql` - Generated migration

### Documentation
- `docs/TRIGGERS_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Comprehensive trigger documentation
- `docs/TRIGGER_SYNC_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Environment Status

| Environment | Net Extension | Approach | Status |
|-------------|---------------|----------|---------|
| **Main** | ❌ Not Available | Queue-based | ✅ Ready for sync |
| **Develop** | ❌ Not Available | Queue-based | ✅ Ready for sync |

## Next Steps

### 1. Apply Migration to Develop
```bash
# Go to DEVELOP Supabase SQL Editor
# Copy and paste contents of: scripts/sync-main-to-develop-complete.sql
# Run the migration
```

### 2. Apply Migration to Main
```bash
# Go to MAIN Supabase SQL Editor  
# Copy and paste contents of: scripts/sync-main-to-develop-complete.sql
# Run the migration
```

### 3. Test Both Environments
```bash
# Test main environment
./scripts/test-system-main.sh e2e

# Test develop environment  
SUPABASE_URL=https://xqkmpkfqoisqzznnvlox.supabase.co ./scripts/test-system.sh e2e
```

### 4. Verify Queue Processing
- Ensure external queue processors are running
- Monitor `audio_generation_queue` table
- Check logs for successful operations

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Eliminated Net Extension Dependency** - Both environments work without `net` extension
2. **Consistent Architecture** - Main and develop use identical trigger logic
3. **Improved Reliability** - Queue-based approach is more robust
4. **Better Monitoring** - Comprehensive logging for debugging
5. **Scalable Design** - Queue system can handle high load

## Technical Details

### Queue Priority System
- **Priority 1:** User preference changes (highest priority)
- **Priority 2:** Alarm creation/updates (normal priority)
- **Priority 3:** Default priority

### Trigger Logic
- **User Preferences:** Triggers on `tts_voice` or `preferred_name` changes
- **Alarms:** Triggers on active alarms with `next_trigger_at` time
- **Scheduling:** Audio generation scheduled 58 minutes before alarm

### Error Handling
- All operations logged to `logs` table
- Queue conflicts handled with `ON CONFLICT` clauses
- Graceful handling of missing data

## Migration Safety

**Production Safe:** This migration is safe for production because:
- Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses for table creation
- Drops and recreates functions safely
- Preserves existing data
- Includes comprehensive logging
- No data loss risk

## Verification Commands

After applying the migration, verify with these SQL queries:

```sql
-- Check triggers exist
SELECT tgname, tgfoid::regproc as function_name 
FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgrelid::regclass::text LIKE 'public.%'
  AND tgname IN ('on_preferences_updated', 'on_preferences_inserted', 'alarm_audio_queue_trigger');

-- Check functions don't use net.http_post
SELECT proname, 
       CASE WHEN prosrc LIKE '%net.http_post%' THEN 'CONTAINS_NET_HTTP_POST' 
            ELSE 'QUEUE_BASED_ONLY' END as status
FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname IN ('trigger_audio_generation', 'manage_alarm_audio_queue');

-- Check tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name IN ('audio_generation_queue', 'logs');
```

## Conclusion

This synchronization resolves the core issue where both environments were trying to use the unavailable `net` extension. The queue-based approach provides a more robust, scalable, and maintainable solution that works consistently across both environments.
